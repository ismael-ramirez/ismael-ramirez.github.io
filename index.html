   <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
      
      Gerald Albright is currently putting the finishing touches on the forthcoming CD project, “30”.  This pivotal number represents 30 years since the release of his debut CD, Just Between Us.

      This self-produced anniversary project is a reflection of some of Albright’s favorite music that he has written over the past three decades!  All of the songs are action-packed with new and unique arrangements, spear-headed by Albright, Chris “Big Dog” Davis, and James “JRob” Roberson.  This CD will prove to be one of Gerald Albright’s finest efforts to date.
      
      It will be released later in 2018.
